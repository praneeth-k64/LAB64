# Feature Specification: LAB64 Group Company Landing Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-lab64-landing`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a landing page for LAB64 company, which is a visionary group company, with very innovative companies into artificial intelligence, agentic systems, drone communications, etc. The main idea of this website/landing site is to give a simple overview of each of the innovative companies, and to lead a user to any of those companies' own website. The landing page must scream of elegant, professional innovation, and must only show cards having the overviews of each of the companies. thats the main purpose of this website."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Company Portfolio (Priority: P1)

As a visitor (potential client, investor, or partner), I want to immediately see all LAB64's innovative portfolio companies in a visually striking way, so I can quickly understand the group's capabilities and areas of expertise.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the landing page - to showcase the portfolio. Without this, the page has no purpose. This represents the MVP that can be immediately deployed and tested.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the landing page and verifying that all company cards are visible with their overviews, and delivers immediate value by showcasing the LAB64 portfolio to any visitor.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a first-time visitor to lab64.com, **When** I land on the homepage, **Then** I see a professional hero section introducing LAB64 as a visionary group company
2. **Given** I have loaded the homepage, **When** I scroll down, **Then** I see a grid/collection of elegant cards, each representing one portfolio company
3. **Given** I am viewing the company cards, **When** I read each card, **Then** each card displays: company name, brief overview (2-3 sentences), key focus area (e.g., "AI & Agentic Systems", "Drone Communications"), and a visual element (logo or icon)
4. **Given** I am on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile), **When** I view the page, **Then** the layout adapts elegantly to my screen size maintaining professional aesthetics

### User Story 2 - Navigate to Portfolio Company Websites (Priority: P2)

As a visitor interested in a specific portfolio company, I want to click on a company card and be taken to that company's dedicated website, so I can learn more detailed information about their offerings.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary conversion action - directing interested visitors to the detailed company websites. While important, the page has value just displaying the portfolio (P1), but becomes fully functional with navigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking each company card and verifying that the user is successfully redirected to the correct external company website, delivering the conversion value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the company cards, **When** I click anywhere on a company card, **Then** I am taken to that company's dedicated website (opens in same or new tab based on best UX practice)
2. **Given** I am viewing a company card, **When** I hover over it (desktop) or tap it (mobile), **Then** I receive clear visual feedback indicating it is clickable (e.g., subtle elevation, border glow, or transformation)
3. **Given** I have clicked on a company card, **When** the external site is loading, **Then** I receive appropriate feedback (loading state if external site is slow)
4. **Given** a company website URL is unavailable or broken, **When** I view that card, **Then** I see a "Coming Soon" badge or visual indicator, and the card is non-clickable

### User Story 3 - Understand LAB64's Vision (Priority: P3)

As a visitor unfamiliar with LAB64, I want to read a concise mission/vision statement, so I understand what LAB64 represents and why these companies are grouped together.

**Why this priority**: This provides context and credibility, but the portfolio itself (P1) is self-explanatory. This enhances understanding but isn't required for the core function.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reading the hero/intro section and verifying that LAB64's value proposition is clearly communicated in under 10 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I land on the homepage, **When** I view the hero section, **Then** I see a compelling tagline or mission statement (1-2 sentences) that communicates LAB64's focus on innovation and cutting-edge technology
2. **Given** I want more context, **When** I view the page, **Then** I see a brief "About LAB64" section (2-4 sentences) explaining the group company concept and focus areas
3. **Given** I am a potential partner or investor, **When** I read the content, **Then** the language conveys professional innovation, credibility, and visionary thinking

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a portfolio company's website URL is not yet available or is broken (404/unreachable)?
- How does the system handle if no portfolio companies are defined (empty state)?
- What happens when a new portfolio company needs to be added - should the page support dynamic content updates or require code changes?
- How does the page handle very long company names or descriptions that exceed card space?
- What happens if a company logo/icon is missing or fails to load?
- How does the page perform for users with slow internet connections (image loading, performance)?
- What accessibility considerations are needed for users with screen readers or keyboard-only navigation?
- How do animated and 3D elements impact page load time and performance on lower-end devices?
- How should SEO be balanced with heavy visual/animated content (e.g., ensuring content is crawlable)?

## Assumptions

- Portfolio companies have existing, live websites that the landing page will link to
- LAB64 has brand assets available (logos, color schemes, company descriptions) for each portfolio company
- The number of portfolio companies is between 3-10 (manageable for a single-page card layout)
- Content updates (adding/removing companies) will be infrequent enough that manual updates are acceptable (alternatively, could use a simple CMS or JSON data file)
- Target audience is professional (B2B clients, investors, partners) who value clean, minimalist, high-end design
- Page will be served over HTTPS with standard web hosting infrastructure
- No user authentication or personalization is required - this is a public-facing landing page
- Standard modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions) are the primary targets
